# Tokyo_Isochrone_Map
Mapping time based ranges of public transportation services in points of interests in Tokyo.

This is a dirty mockup project that would hopefully be useful to my real estate agent. It is really hard to find a good (cheap and okayish) apartment in Tokyo, it gets even harder when you don't know about districts and your agent starts to ask if this area is good. 

Idea is I'll probably be happy with an apartment 20- 25 minutes to common districts, so I can safely return home after a night of drinking. So this project builds a isochronic map of areas that are close to a busy district.
